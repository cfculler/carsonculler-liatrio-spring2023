# carsonculler-liatrio-spring2023
Hi all,
My name is Carson Culler, and I'm really excited to be here! 
This repo hosts my apprenticeship exercise for the Liatrio apprenticeship for Spring 2023.
There should be consistent updates to this repo, and a full description of the project will be added to the README upon completion.
